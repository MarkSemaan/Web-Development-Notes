Okay, straight to the point:

*   **Authentication:** Verifies **who** you are. It confirms your identity (e.g., by checking your username and password).

*   **Authorization:** Determines **what** you are allowed to do. It grants or denies access to specific resources or actions based on your identity and assigned permissions.

**Relationship:** Authentication always happens **before** authorization. You must first prove *who* you are before the system can decide *what* you can access or do.
